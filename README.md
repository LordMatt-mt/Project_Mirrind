# Project_Mirrind
An 80s style game inspired by early games like space invaders 

This project is still currently being made but it’s a prototype at the mean time. The whole idea of the game is you move the player only side to side and you have cubes moving towards you and you have to destroy them and increase your score before they move past you and reduce your health. The pace of the cubes increases over time to add more difficulty but I also plan to have choices of difficulty for example one difficulty will have the cubes spawn in different colours and you have to choose the right bullet to match the cubes colour and another difficulty will have the spawned cubes change colours. This game will have a 80s feel to it where the cubes have a glow to them and you’ll have a top down view looking at a 80s style grid like from Tron and it’s really inspired by early simple games such as space invaders and so on. A title for the game is still a work in progress but I plan to call it laser outrun or something similar.
